"Welcome to my file. This is a trial version uploaded on GitHub by me. To get it working, you first need to install MetaMask on your Chrome browser, create a wallet, and then generate a key to secure your wallet. Please note that you need to top up your ETH wallet within the limits set by MetaMask. When you run the Python command run.py, it will charge you $1 for any transactions, no matter how many transactions there are, it will only cost $1. Please feel free to contact me if you need help via Telegram: @AIVCAM (I am MattFeuter). Below is my full commitment."

The tools we share on GITHUB may be downloaded by thieves who add features to steal cryptocurrency wallets. Therefore, please make sure to download them only directly from my GITHUB page or from my Telegram messages, to avoid falling victim to scams. It's best not to trust anyone to prevent losing money.

Personally, I do not sell FLASH coins. I created it for you to use and improve. I also do not cooperate or work with any individual or organization for business transactions involving FLASH coins. You can purchase my tool and use it anytime you want.

I am the developer of this tool, and it only includes features that work with FLASH. I do not store or steal wallets from my personal software. You should be cautious when using software downloaded from the internet as it might steal your wallet through scams. I will not be responsible for any loss of money if you use tools from other sources. You can use my tool if you trust it, and it might help you in your work. I advise you to research thoroughly before using software from any third party.
